5. **Which 2025 game had the highest attendance?**

## Advanced Questions Answered by LLM in Week 2:

1. **Who was the most improved returning player (2024 ‚Üí 2025) by points per game (PPG = (G+A)/GP)?**
Answer: Olivia Adamson (+1.561 PPG; 2024: 3.773 ‚Üí 2025: 5.333)

2. **Did SU improve more on offense or defense year-over-year?**
GF/G = goals for per game; GA/G = goals against per game.

2024: GF/G 14.50, GA/G 10.25, Win% 58.3%

2025: GF/G 13.20, GA/G 11.20, Win% 50.0%
Answer: Offense slipped (‚àí1.30 GF/G) while defense allowed more (+0.95 GA/G). Net: both offense and defense regressed in the 2025 rows you provided.

3. **‚ÄúClutch‚Äù performance‚Äîhow did SU do in close games (|goal diff| ‚â§ 2)?**

2024 close games: 0‚Äì2 (2 games)

2025 close games: 1‚Äì2 (3 games)
Answer: Slightly better clutch results in 2025 (1 win vs 0), but still under .500 in close ones.

4. **Who led 2025 in shooting efficiency (G/Sh), minimum 30 shots?**
Answer: Gracie Britton ‚Äî 0.488 (41 shots, min threshold = 30).

5. **If the coach wants +2 more wins in 2025, should the focus be offense or defense?**
Simple simulation (apply evenly in every game):

Actual 2025 wins: 5

Add +1 goal to SU in every game: still 5 wins

Prevent 1 goal in every game: still 5 wins
Answer: With a uniform +1 GF or ‚àí1 GA, the 2025 outcomes don‚Äôt change on these rows; that suggests targeted improvement (specific matchups or close-loss situations) would matter more than a uniform tweak. A good next pass is a targeted swing (e.g., add +1 goal only in losses decided by 1‚Äì2) or opponent-specific adjustments.
